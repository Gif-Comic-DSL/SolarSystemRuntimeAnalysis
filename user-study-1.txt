Notes from first user study:
- show method calls as spaceship moves instead of just flying around
- make the spaceship's movement follow the structure of a sequence diagram more closely so it's easier to understand

Changes planned:
- add method names to dynamic logging and display the name as the spaceship flies between planets
- show method calls and returns in addition to movement between instances of classes
