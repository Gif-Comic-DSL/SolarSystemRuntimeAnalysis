# MILESTONE 1
## Project: Space Adventure Dynamic Analysis

### Brief Desctiption:
For our program analysis project, we plan to illustrate the control flow of a program using a Solar System analogy
- The sun could represent the main class
- Other planets represent other classes
- Control flow will be visualized using a spaceship, which will travel between the planets
- Exceptions and errors can be modelled using blackholes or explosions
- Relationships between classes will be represented by shooting star lines

### Feedback from TA:
- How much would you be implementing as opposed to using existing libraries?
- Will you be implementing the visualization and/or analysis components?
- It would be a good idea to add something about what approach you are planning to follow in the milestone as a follow-up point. 

### Planned follow-ups / features still to design:
- We're planning to analyze a Java program and know that we'll be using an existing library to build the AST.
- Beyond this, we haven't decided exactly what the implementation breakdown will look like yet
- This will be fleshed out next week when we meet to decide how to move forward and which parts each of us will be responsible for
