# MILESTONE 1
## Project: Space Adventure Dynamic Analysis

### Brief Desctiption:
For our program analysis project, we plan to illustrate the control flow of a program using a Solar System analogy
- The sun could represent the main class
- Other planets represent other classes
- Control flow will be visualized using a spaceship, which will travel between the planets
- Exceptions and errors can be modelled using blackholes or explosions
- Relationships between classes will be represented by shooting star lines

### Feedback from TA:
- How much would you be implementing as opposed to using existing libraries?
- Will you be implementing the visualization and/or analysis components?
- It would be a good idea to add something about what approach you are planning to follow in the milestone as a follow-up point. 

### Planned follow-ups / features still to design:
- We plan to use existing libraries to implement the visualization components, however this will still require a 
non-trivial amount of work. Currently we are considering/investigating the below libraries for this purpose:
  - https://typpo.github.io/spacekit/
  - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/
  - https://www.creative-technologies.de/space-game-visualization-engine/ (example built on three.js for reference/inspiration)

- For the control flow analysis, we will need to do more research and perhaps material from the next few lectures. We would ideally use some existing debugger functionality to step through a programâ€™s execution in discrete steps and extract the information needed for our visualization.
