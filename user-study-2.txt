Notes from second user study:
- running back end is really complicated and has too many steps
- UFO/planet labels were overlapped making them hard to read
- visualization runs for a long time on large/complex target programs

Changes implemented:
- wrote bash script to perform back end calls (takes paths as user input). This allows the user to run the analysis and produce the visualization easily
- moved the UFO labels upwards so they sit on top of planet labels
- sped up the space ship flight slightly so the labels are still readable but the flight doesn't take so long
