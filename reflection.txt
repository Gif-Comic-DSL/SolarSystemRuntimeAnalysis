Reflection on effectiveness of analysis/visualization:
Overall, our user studies showed that our visualization was interesting and engaging to show the control flow of any given Java program.
While users found it confusing to hook up all the back end pieces and pass the logs to the front end on the command line, we implemented a bash script to automate this process given some file paths from the user.
With this script, running the whole analysis and visualization became user friendly and our users were much happier!
They commented that they particularly liked the explosion that occurs when an exception is thrown.

Reflection/evaluation of project:
This project went very well, both in terms of the final result and the inner workings of the team.
     - We bounced ideas off of each other in a friendly way and were able to come to a consensus on the best way forward
     - We were able to shift responsibilities to accommodate external responsibilities (families, other course assignments/midterms, job interviews...) while keeping the division of work fairly even among the five of us
     - We took feedback from each other and from outside users without offense and did not have any internal conflicts
     - We tried many different approaches to our dynamic analysis and worked together to settle on one that we were able to fully implement
     - We're proud of our final project!!
